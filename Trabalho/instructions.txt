- On Windows, you'd get the debug build from 
  CMake running this command:
cmake -B build
cmake --build build

- Then run your newly-built program like so:
build\Debug\ExemploSimples.exe > image.ppm

- Later, it will be better to run optimized builds for speed. 
  In that case, you would build like this:
cmake --build build --config release

- and would run the optimized program like this:
build\Release\ExemploSimples.exe > image.ppm

- The examples above assume that you are building with CMake, 
  using the same approach as the CMakeLists.txt file in the 
  included source. Use whatever build environment (and language) 
  you're most comfortable with.
